			<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Georgia State University and a
			graduated RA at the Center for State and Local Finance (CSFL). My main
			research interest lies in the intersection of environmental, public, and
			development economics. My most recent research has mainly focused on the
			quantitative analysis of environmental and social policy in developing
			countries.</p>
			<p>I am an economist from Universidad de los Andes (Bogota, Colombia),
			from where I also hold a master’s degree in economics. I am expected
			graduation date is Spring 2023. You can find my <strong>curriculum
			vitae</strong>, <em><a href="CV/latestCV.pdf">here</a></em>.</p>

    		<p><strong>Colombian Carbon Tax: Evidence of Carbon Pricing in
			Developing Countries</strong>. August, 2022.</p>
			<p><font size="2"><em>Recently, Colombia implemented its first Carbon
			tax. In 2017, it became the 3rd country in Latin America to implement it
			and the 23rd in the world. However, its implementation is just one
			example of how middle and low-income countries have started implementing
			this kind of market-based strategy. This paper seeks to understand the
			effects of the Colombian tax on the consumption of various fuels and
			emissions of CO2. I use a set of estimators, recently named as
			counterfactual estimators, that are shown to provide a more flexible
			framework to provide consistent treatment efefcts estimators. I find
			evidence that the tax reform reduces Colombia’s emission of CO2 per
			capita by almost 13% per year within four years after its
			implementation. Although the results are not statistically
			significative, there is evidence that the tax is effectively reducing
			the fuels consumption, and suggest that the failure to reject a zero
			effect might come from power restrictions of the design.</em></font></p>

			<p><a href="https://bit.ly/2XYafgg"><strong>COVID-19 mortality and
			contemporaneous air pollution</strong></a>. With W. Austin, S. Carattini
			and M. Pesko. Revisions Requested at Journal of Environmental Economics
			and Management. October 2020.</p>
			<p><font size="2"><em>We examine the relationship between
			contemporaneous fine particulate matter exposure and COVID-19 morbidity
			and mortality using an instrumental variable approach based on wind
			direction. Harnessing daily changes in county-level wind direction, we
			show that arguably exogenous fluctuations in local air quality impact
			the rate of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19. In our preferred
			high dimensional fixed effects specification with state-level policy and
			social distancing controls, we find that a one g/m^3 increase in PM 2.5
			increases the number of confirmed cases by roughly 2% from the mean case
			rate in a county. These effects tend to increase in magnitude over
			longer time horizons, being twice as large over a 3-day period.
			Meanwhile, a one g/m^3 increase in PM 2.5 increases the same-day death
			rate by 3% from the mean. Our estimates are robust to a host of
			sensitivity tests. These results suggest that air pollution plays an
			important role in mediating the severity of respiratory syndromes such
			as COVID-19, for which progressive respiratory failure is the primary
			cause of death, and that policy levers to improve air quality may lead
			to improvements in COVID-19 outcomes.</em></font></p>
			<p><a href="https://bit.ly/32CAgEp"><strong>The Graduation approach for
			the reduction of extreme poverty: impact evaluation of Sembrando
			Oportunidades Familia por Familia in Paraguay</strong></a>. With J. H.
			Maldonado, V. León-Jurado, D. Rodríguez, and L. Villa. (2019). Documento
			CEDE, (2019-19). Revision requested at Journal of Development
			Effectiveness.</p>
			<p><font size="2"><em>Rural poverty, a widespread problem for the
			governments, led to the implementation of the “Sembrando Oportunidades
			Familia por Familia” program (Seeding Opportunities Family by Family),
			an initiative based on the graduation approach. This is one of the few
			cases in which governments are running this type of program. In this
			study, we evaluate the intervention outcomes to understand the
			effectiveness of this approach in reducing poverty. The evaluation shows
			positive changes in income, productive capacity, savings behavior, and
			perception of well-being but exhibits discrete consumption effects.
			These results might be associated with the need for governments to
			intervene rural communities with other programs. The results are helpful
			to adjust the design and prepare the scaling of programs that can help
			effectively overcome extreme poverty in this and other developing
			countries.</em></font></p>
